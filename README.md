Hi. Welcome to the Daisyworld.

You can run the program in your terminal using the following command, whilst in the root directory:

python run main.py

You can change the parameter values in main.py and re-execute to see different behaviour.'
the results will be printed to the terminal and to a csv file called "daisyWorldOutput.csv which can be viewed in Excel or Numbers.
